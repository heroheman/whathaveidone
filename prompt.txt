Overall summary: Summarize all changes in the Git history in short, concise bullet points by grouping similar changes and highlighting their main topics and functions.

- Breakdown by day: Provide a summary of the changes for each day in a single line, highlighting the most important changes and features.
- If ticket numbers (format: [letter code]-[number sequence]) appear in the commit, add them to the daily overview at the end. e.g. "[...] relates to CPT-2345 and DSG-23212"
- If the commits are from multiple projects, repeat the output for each project, separated by --- and two line breaks before and after
- If there are no commits, this does not need to be mentioned.
- Use markdown, preserve it in the output, including spaces

Example for the Git history from [date] to [date]:
## [PROJECT NAME from GIT] - Timeframe: [FROM] - [TO]
